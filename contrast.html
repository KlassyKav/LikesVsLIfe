                            <h4>Connectivity</h4>
<p> Social media bridges the gap between different cultures and geographies, allowing people from all over the world to connect and share ideas. It fosters a sense of global community and can help teens build relationships beyond their immediate environment. According to a Pew Research Center study, 81% of teens say social media makes them feel more connected to their friends.<strong> Source:</strong>Pew Research Center, Teens’ Social Media Habits and Experiences, November 28, 2018.<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/11/28/teens-and-their-experiences-on-social-media/" target="_blank">Read more.</a></p>
                                                       
<h4>Information Dissemination and Awareness</h4>
<p>Social media acts as a powerful tool for spreading information quickly and efficiently. It’s particularly useful in raising awareness about various issues and events, from social justice movements to emergency alerts. Teens can stay informed and engaged with the world around them. The survey found that more than half of teens (54%) get news at least a few times a week from social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter and 50% get news from YouTube.<strong> Source: </strong>Source: Prnewswire, New Survey Reveals Teens Get Their News from Social Media and YouTube, accessed from <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-survey-reveals-teens-get-their-news-from-social-media-and-youtube-300900557.html" target="_blank">this link.</a></p>

                            <h4>Privacy and Security Concerns</h4>
<p> Users often worry about the safety of their personal information on social media platforms. The lack of control over who can access this information raises concerns about privacy and data security. Teens, in particular, may not always be aware of the risks associated with sharing personal details online. On average, 1.4 billion social media accounts are hacked every month, and this number is expected to rise as more people create accounts. <strong> Source: </strong> Spencer Abel, Top Social Media Hacking Statistics and Trends for 2025, December 10, 2024.<a href="https://www.stationx.net/social-media-hacking-statistics/" target="_blank">Read More.</a> </p>
                            
<h4>Cyber Bullying and Online Harassment </h4>
 <p>The anonymity provided by social media can sometimes lead to cyberbullying and online harassment, causing significant emotional distress to the victims. This can have long-lasting effects on a teen’s mental health and self-esteem. The anonymity of social media can sometimes lead to cyberbullying, with 59% of U.S. teens reporting that they have been harassed or bullied online. <strong> Source: </strong>Pew Research Center, A Majority of Teens Have Experienced Some Form of Cyberbullying, September 27, 2018. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/09/27/a-majority-of-teens-have-experienced-some-form-of-cyberbullying/" target="_blank"> Read More.</a></p>
                            
<h4>Fake News and Misinformation </h4>
<p>The spread of fake news and misinformation is a major issue on social media platforms. This can lead to confusion, misinformation, and in some cases, even incite violence or unrest. Teens need to develop critical thinking skills to discern credible sources from unreliable ones. According to the Center Statistics Office (CSO), 62% of data on the internet is unreliable. Similarly, UCLA's Center for Communication Policy found that 47.3% of online information was false. Social media platforms have been identified as sources with the highest prevalence of unreliable content. <strong> Source: </strong>Naveen Kumar, 20 Fake News Statistics For 2025 (Latest Data and Facts), November 6, 2024.<a href="https://www.demandsage.com/fake-news-statistics/"target="_blank"> Read More.</a></p>
