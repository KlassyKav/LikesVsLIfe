            <h2>The Role Social Media Plays in the Lives of Teenagers</h2>
            <p>Social media plays a pivotal role in shaping teenagers’ lives, influencing their self-perception, social interactions, and creativity. However, it also presents challenges such as privacy concerns, cyberbullying, and the spread of misinformation.</p>

                    <h3>Teen's Dependancy on Social Media</h3>    
                        <p>Teens often rely on social media for social interactions, self-expression, and entertainment. However, this dependency can lead to distractions from important activities like homework and exercise, disrupted sleep, and exposure to incorrect or biased information. It can also lead to oversharing of personal information and unrealistic perceptions of others’ lives. Fully 95% of teens have access to a smartphone, and 45% say they are online ‘almost constantly.<strong> Source: </strong>Pew Research Center, Teens, Social Media and Technology 2018, May 31, 2018. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/" target="_blank"> Read more.</a> </p>

                    <h3>Social Media's impact on Mental Health</h3>    
                        <p>Excessive use of social media can have a significant impact on teens’ mental health. It can expose them to cyberbullying and discrimination, which can increase the risk of anxiety and depression. Stress posting, or posting content when upset, can also lead to regret and further mental distress. Teens who spend more than three hours a day on social media are more likely to report high levels of behaviors that may indicate mental health problems, compared to adolescents who do not use social media at all. <strong> Source: </strong>Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Teen Social Media Use May Increase Risk of Mental Health Problems, September 11, 2019. <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2019/09/11/social-media-teen-mental-health/" target="_blank"> Read more.</a>

                    <h3>Social Media Addiction Issues</h3>    
                        <p>The rewarding nature of social media interactions can lead to addictive behaviors. The brain’s reward center is triggered by likes, shares, and comments, creating a high similar to gambling or drug use. This can lead to obsessive behaviors and exacerbate mental health disorders like anxiety, depression, ADHD, and body dysmorphia. In a 2016 survey, half of teenagers reported that they “feel addicted” to their mobile devices, and 72% said they felt the need to immediately respond to texts and social networking messages.<strong> Source: </strong>2019 Children's Mental Health Report by Child Mind Institute. <a href="https://childmind.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2019_Childrens_Mental_Health_Report_Full.pdf" target="_blank"> Read more.</a>

                        <p>Excessive use of social media can lead to physical health issues as well. It can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to sedentary behaviors. The constant need for immediate gratification can also lead to stress and anxiety. A study showed that spending too much time on social media raises the risk of developing eating disorders by 2.2 times and social media use is linked to a 40% higher risk of sleep problems. <strong> Source: </strong>  Social Media Mental Health Statistics By Negative Effects, Self-Esteem, Impact, and Cyberbullying, accessed from <a href="https://electroiq.com/stats/social-media-mental-health-statistics/" target="_blank"> ElectroIQ.</a> </p>

                    <h3>Mindset Shifts caused by Social Media</h3>    
                        <p>Social media can significantly influence teens’ mindsets. It can lead to feelings of loneliness, low self-esteem, and envy. The pressure to be constantly online and part of the group can also lead to feelings of exclusion and self-doubt. According to a study, approximately 40% of teen social media users report feeling pressure to post only content that makes them look good to others. <strong> Source: </strong> Pew Research Center, Teens, Technology and Friendships, August 6, 2015. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/08/06/teens-technology-and-friendships/" target="_blank"> Read More. </a>
